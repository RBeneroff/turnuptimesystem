When a user visits TurnUpTimeSystem's home page the user has the choice of signing up or logging in. A user cannot use or view the rest of the app until logging in.

Once logged in, the user is brought to the All Projects page. This page consists of a of all the projects in the database. If a user is working on one of these projects, they can click on the project and they will be brought to that project's detail page. If there are no current projects or the user needs to create a new project, they can click the Add A Project button.

On the Project Details page, the user has the option of clicking edit to update the project's name, description, or add tasks (and task name and description as well). The user can also delete the entire project here. If the user would like to start tracking their time, they can click the play button next to the task they are working on. When the user is done working on that project for that time period, they can click the stop button. Every task will display the total amount of time spent on each specific task (non-specific to user) as well as an overall time with the total hours spent on the project. When you click the Click for Details button next to each task the user will see every user that has clocked in time on that task.

When a project is completed, the user can click the Completed? button and the project will move to the Completed Projects page. The Completed Projects page works the exact same way the All Projects page works, except users cannot edit or update their time on tasks. If a user realizes that a project is not yet complete, they can go to the completed projects and un-click the button for a specific project which will move the project back to the user's home page.

The Account page displays the dashboard for the app. Here the user can update their password and view other statistics about their projects, tasks and use of the app.
